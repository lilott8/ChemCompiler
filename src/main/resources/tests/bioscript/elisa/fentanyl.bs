instructions

a = mix 20uL of urine_sample with antigen

b = mix 100uL of fentanyl_conjugate with a for 60s

heat b at 23c for 60m

drain b

repeat 6 times {
  z = mix 350uL of distilled_water with a for 45s
  drain z
}

a = mix 100uL of tmb_substrate with a

heat a at 23c for 30m

a = mix a with 100uL of stop_reagent for 60s

negative_reading = detect fluorescence on a for 30m

drain a
