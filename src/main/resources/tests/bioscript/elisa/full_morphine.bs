instructions

a = mix 20uL of negative_standard with Antigen1
b = mix 20uL of positive_standard with Antigen2
cc = mix 20uL of diluted_sample with Antigen3

a = mix 100uL of morphine_conjugate with a for 60s
b = mix 100uL of morphine_conjugate with b for 60s
cc = mix 100uL of morphine_conjugate with cc for 60s

heat a at 23c for 60m
heat b at 23c for 60m
heat cc at 23c for 60m

drain a
drain b
drain cc

repeat 6 times {
  aa = mix 350uL of distilled_water with Antigen1 for 45s
  bb = mix 350uL of distilled_water with Antigen2 for 45s
  cc = mix 350uL of distilled_water with Antigen3 for 45s

  drain aa
  drain bb
  drain cc

}

aa = mix 100uL of tmb_substrate with Antigen1
bb = mix 100uL of tmb_substrate with Antigen2
cc = mix 100uL of tmb_substrate with Antigen3

heat aa at 23c for 30m
heat bb at 23c for 30m
heat cc at 23c for 30m

aa = mix stop_reagent with 100uL of aa for 60s
bb = mix stop_reagent with 100uL of bb for 60s
cc = mix stop_reagent with 100uL of cc for 60s

negative_reading = detect fluorescence on aa for 30m
positive_reading = detect fluorescence on bb for 30m
sample_reading = detect fluorescence on cc for 30m

drain aa
drain bb
