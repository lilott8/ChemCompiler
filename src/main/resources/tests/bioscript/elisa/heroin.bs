instructions

a = mix 20uL of urine_sample with 1uL of heroin_enzyme for 10s
a = mix 100uL of heroin_conjugate with a for 60s
heat a at 23c for 60m
drain a

repeat 6 times {
  b = mix 350uL of distilled_water with heroin_enzyme for 45s
  drain heroin_enzyme
}

cc = mix 100uL of tmb_substrate with heroin_enzyme
heat cc at 23c for 30m
cc = mix stop_reagent with 100uL of cc for 60s

urine_reading = detect fluorescence on cc for 30m
drain cc
